Simple React app without using redux to imitate youtube Play time using youtube API.


Day-1: {
    - deleted unwanted code
    - created first component
    - ceated a new youtube search API
    - NPM package for youtube-api-search added to the node modules in locally and also to the package.json file.


    STATE: State is nothing but a javaScript object which is used to keep a track and record USER EVENTS.
    
    DOWNWARDS DATA FLOW: The most parent component is always responsible for fetching the data.
}
